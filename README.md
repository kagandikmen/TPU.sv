# TPU.sv

This is an attempt of mine to rebuild Google's TPUv1 (Tensor Processing Unit, version 1) in SystemVerilog.

## Approach

These are the main sources I utilize:

- [Google's 2018 paper introducing TPU's architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04760)
- ["Implementierung einer Tensor Processing Unit" by Jonas Fuhrmann](https://reposit.haw-hamburg.de/handle/20.500.12738/8527)
- [tinyTPU by Jonas Fuhrmann](https://github.com/jofrfu/tinyTPU/)

My current goal is to get to know how tinyTPU was implemented and imitate it for the time being. Once I am comfortable with the architecture I will begin to apply my own changes further modifying/improving it.
